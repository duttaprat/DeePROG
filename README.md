# Multi-modalGene

## This is the readme file that contains the guidelines and information about the compilation of the code of the following paper

**Paper Name:-** An Attention based Deep Multi-modal Architecturefor Disease Gene Prognosis
- **Authors:** Pratik Dutta, Aditya Prakash Patra, and Sriparna Saha 
- **Affiliation:**  Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Patna, India. 



## Prerequisities
* **[Python 2.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/)**
* **[sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)**
* **[matplotlib 2.0+](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)**
* **[mpl_toolkits](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/mpl_toolkits/index.html)**
* **[numpy 1.10+](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)**
* **[Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)**
* **[Keras](https://keras.io/)**


## Dataset
It contains three modalities of all three disease gene datsets. These three modalities are
* **Gene Expression Profile**  Uploaded in Github.
* **Underlying FASTA sequence** Download from the [google link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qg_FRrRQn8k9JGNJaRlEY1no2Q5Xlo3-?usp=sharing).
* **3D PDB structure** Due to large size, you can download partial data from the [google link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZfaqRF3QlhrWzWc53IDAmLSUEaHZ714R?usp=sharing).


## Multi-modality Codes

It contains `.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebok) files for all deep learning-based multi-modal architectures for all three disease gene datasets(**_BCLL_**, **_ILD_** and **_Prostrate_**). For each datasets, we have created three separate folders. Each folders contain `Unimodal`, `Bimodal` and `Trimodal` subfolders that contains the `python` scripts of **`self attention-based`** deep multi-modal architectures.   

The details procedure of running the code will be described after accepting or upon a personal request in my [official email ID](mailto:pratik.pcs16@iitp.ac.in).
